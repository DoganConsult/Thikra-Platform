بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

هذا المشروع صدقة جارية لروح عمر ولكل من فقدناهم.
اللهم اغفر لهم وارحمهم وأسكنهم فسيح جناتك.

This project is Sadaqah Jariyah (perpetual charity) for the soul of Omar
and all departed loved ones. May Allah forgive them, have mercy on them,
and grant them the highest levels of Paradise.
